â™¦ Introduction:
This readme.txt file provides a description of the Gherkin 
test cases that have been created by Carlos Castrillo to 
test the login, signup, log out, adding a product to the 
cart and validating the product in the cart functionality 
on the website https://www.demoblaze.com/index.html
The Faker library is used to generate unique users for each 
test execution.

â™¦ Test Cases:
The test cases are written in Gherkin language and are 
organized into different scenarios. Each scenario covers 
a specific aspect of the login, signup, log out, adding a 
product to the cart and validating the product in the cart 
functionality. They are written in the third person and 
are detailed and easy to understand.
