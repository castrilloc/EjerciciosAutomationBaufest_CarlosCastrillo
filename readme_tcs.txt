Introduction:
This readme.txt file provides a description of the Gherkin 
test cases that have been created by Carlos Castrillo to 
test the login, signup, log out, adding a product to the 
cart and validating the product in the cart functionality 
on the website https://www.demoblaze.com/index.html
The Faker library is used to generate unique users for each 
test execution.

Test Cases:
The test cases are written in Gherkin language and are 
organized into different scenarios. Each scenario covers 
a specific aspect of the login, signup, log out, adding a 
product to the cart and validating the product in the cart 
functionality. They are written in the third person and 
are detailed and easy to understand.

Testing the login functionality:
The test cases for testing the login functionality include 
scenarios for successful login, unsuccessful login due to 
incorrect username or password, unsuccessful login due to 
blank fields and testing the remember me function.

Testing the signup functionality:
The test cases for testing the signup functionality include 
scenarios for successful signup, unsuccessful signup due to 
invalid email, mismatch password, blank fields, and already 
registered email.
